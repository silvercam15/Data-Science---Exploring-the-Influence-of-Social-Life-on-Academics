    "Our project will be based on a dataset from Kaggle that explores the effect of socioeconomic factors on students grades from a survey of studentsâ€™ math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. The dataset contains data gathered from Portuguese students who were surveyed on several different aspects of their life, including familial and social relations as well as their academic habits and socio-economic status.We plan to use the data set to predict a student's final grade in a class based on different social factors, including the amount of time he or she spends going out with friends, the quality of their family relationships, whether they take part in after-school activities, as well as the size of their family. Using several features, we want to see if there is a correlation between a student's social life and their grades. We also want to see if there is one specific feature (or a combination of features) that better predicts whether a student's grade will be above average, average, or below average. \n",
